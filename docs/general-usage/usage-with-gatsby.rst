Using Grapple with Gatsby
=========================

``wagtail-grapple`` provides a GraphQL API to Wagtail's contents, which can be accessed by a wide range of consumers.

One very common use case is using Gatsby to fetch contents from Wagtail CMS then building and deploying a static site (developed in React).

Frontend developers using Gatsby should check out `gatsby-source-wagtail <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wagtail/>`_, a plugin
designed to interface directly with ``wagtail-grapple`` to streamline querying of Wagtail.
