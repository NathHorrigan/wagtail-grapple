Using Grapple with Gatsby
=========================

``wagtail-grapple`` provides a GraphQL API to Wagtail content that can be accessed by a wide range of consumers.

One common use case is to use Gatsby to fetch content from Wagtail, then build and deploy a static site built in React.

Frontend developers using Gatsby should check out `gatsby-source-wagtail <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wagtail/>`_, a plugin
designed to interface directly with ``wagtail-grapple`` to streamline queries to Wagtail.
